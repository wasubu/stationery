# stationery
an app for keeping track of your stationary 

Well it's the usual thing where I just make a repo for an Idea I had and never work on it. It's the same thing.
This app ables you to put your stationary. I had this idea where the main UI will have a rotating thingy where swipping will rotate to the different stationaries you have.
Why this? I recently stumbled upon the copic markers app and I wanted some things to work in a certain way. The app encourages you to buy more copic markers rather than
seeing what are the things you currently have.
